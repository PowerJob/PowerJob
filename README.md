- Have you ever wondered how cron jobs could be organized orderly? 
- Have you ever felt upset when scheduling tasks suddenly terminated without any warning?
- Have you ever felt helpless when batches of business tasks require handling?
- Have you ever felt depressed about tasks that carry with complex dependencies?

Well, PowerJob is there for you, it is the choice of a new generation. It is a powerful, business-oriented scheduling framework that provides distributed computing ability. Based on Akka architecture, it makes everything with scheduling easier. Just with several steps, PowerJob could be deployed and work for you!

# Introduction

### Features
-   Simple to use: PowerJob provides a friendly front-end Web that allows developers to visually manage tasks (Create, Read, Update and Delete), monitor tasks, and view logs online.
-   Complete timing strategy:  PowerJob supports four different scheduling strategies, including CRON expression, fixed frequency timing, fixed delay timing as well as the Open API.
-   Various execution modes: PowerJob supports four execution modes: stand-alone, broadcast, Map, and MapReduce. It's worth mentioning the Map and MapReduce modes. With several lines of codes, developers could take full advantage of PowerJob's distributed computing ability.
-   Complete workflow support. PowerJob supports DAG(Directed acyclic graph) based online task configuration. Developers could arrange tasks on the console, while data could be transferred among tasks on the flow.
-   Extensive executor support: PowerJob supports multiple processors, including Spring Beans, ordinary Java objects, Shell, Python and so on.
-   Simple in dependency: PowerJob aims to be simple in dependency. The only dependency is merely database (MySQL / Oracle / MS SQLServer ...), with MongoDB being the extra dependency for storing large log files online.
-   High availability and performance: Unlike traditional job-scheduling frameworks that rely on database locks, PowerJob server is lock-free. PowerJob supports unlimited horizontal expansion. It's easy to achieve high availability and performance by deploying as many PowerJob server instances as you need.
-   Quick failover and recovery support: Whenever any task failed, PowerJob server would retry according to the configured strategy. As long as there were enough nodes in the cluster, the failed tasks could execute successfully finally.
-   Convenient to run and maintain: PowerJob supports online logging. Logs generated by the worker would be transferred and displayed on the console instantly, therefore reducing the cost of debugging and improving the efficiency significantly.

### Applicable scenes

-   Scenarios with timed tasks: such as full synchronization of data at midnight, generating business reports at desired time.
-   Scenarios that require all machines to run tasks simultaneously: such as log cleanup.
-   Scenarios that require distributed processing: For example, a large amount of data requires updating, while the stand-alone execution takes quite a lot of time. The Map/MapReduce mode could be applied in which the workers would join the cluster for PowerJob server to dispatch, to speed up the time-consuming process, therefore improving the computing ability of the whole cluster.
-   Scenarios with delayed tasks: For instance, disposal of overdue orders.

### Design goals

PowerJob aims to be an enterprise scheduling middleware. By deploying PowerJob-server as the scheduling center,
all the applications could gain scheduling and distributed computing ability relying on PowerJob-worker.
